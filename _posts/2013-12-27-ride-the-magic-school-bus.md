title: Ride the Magic School Bus
---
Why not start with a classic? These books were used in my
elementary years and are among the most vivid memories of
learning that I have, likely because the idea of zooming
around the planets or inside a human body let the imagination
run wild. Through the wonder of Netflix, I have come to find
out there was a television series spinoff of the books.
My 7-year-old watches it by choice, and more than a few times
this show has been his answer to a question that occurs
regularly in our house - "Where did you learn that?"

You may have noticed some science subject links on the site menu.
These contain my collection of links to educational resources.
To start filling in some material, I've organized some of
the Magic School Bus video series episodes by topic.
Yes, many episodes have a very contrived set of circumstances
that lead to the class exploring a certain topic (like, who ever
heard of a smell contest?), but then again you are already stepping into
another reality when you accept that there is a bus that
can transform into just about anything and go anywhere.
My only other caveat is that there is some mild crude humor
that may be inappropriate for some of the youngest learners.

If you have a Netflix subscription, you can directly follow
the Netflix links in the resource catalog to start watching
that episode (or go to the [full series](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Magic_School_Bus/70264612)).
You can also buy the full series from various places like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-School-Bus-Complete/dp/B007I1Q4MM).

If you or your child/student is currently studying one
of these topics, go ahead and start watching, or pick a random
one and learn something unexpected.
The original books are also great and often have a much richer
information, so I expect
I'll also catalog them at some point.

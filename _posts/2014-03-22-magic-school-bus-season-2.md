title: Magic School Bus Season 2
---
I spent a few minutes this blustery morning adding Season 2
of the Magic School Bus into the Relateucate database.
Interesting that the majority of this series is
turning out to be [biology](http://jeffbaumes.github.io/relateucate/subjects/biology/) based. Enjoy!

If you have a Netflix subscription, you can directly follow
the Netflix links in the resource catalog to start watching
that episode (or go to the [full series](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Magic_School_Bus/70264612)).
You can also buy the full series from various places like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Magic-School-Bus-Complete/dp/B007I1Q4MM).

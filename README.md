# [Relateucate](http://jeffbaumes.github.io/relateucate)

Modern learning.

I'd welcome others adding to the catalog of
educational links with pull requests on files in the `_data` folder.
If you have a post that you think would
be relevant, go ahead and send me a `_draft/your-cool-post.md` pull
request.

I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to build the site and
[Hyde](http://andhyde.com) as a starting point for a theme.

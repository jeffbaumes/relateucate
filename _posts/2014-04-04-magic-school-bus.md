title: Magic School Bus Complete, What's Next?
---
Now that the 52-episode Magic School Bus TV series is entered in its entirety, this looks like
"Magic-School-Bus"-ucate rather than Relateucate.

What could come next?

* Beakman's World - A potpurri science show that I remember fondly from my middle school years.
* Mr. Wizard - Need I say more? Wish this was on Netflix.
* Khan Academy - This is a premier and growing set of open educational materials covering many subjects. Not sure I can keep up with this one but I could try to link into some higher-level materials.
* Books - I could review some of the better educational books we have used in homeschooling.
